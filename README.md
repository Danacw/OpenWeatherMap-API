# Python-API-Challenge
Python API WeatherPy and VacationPy challenges for UC Davis Data Analytics Bootcamp - Spring 2021

**Methods:**

For this challenge, I created a Python script in Jupyter Notebook and used OpenWeather Map's API to visualize data on weather trends for 500+ cities across the globe. I first performed API calls to find information on temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed in each city. I then used MatPlotLib to generate scatter plots and run a regression analysis for each graph.  

**Analysis:**

From our final analysis, we can come to a few general conclusions about weather trends across the globe. First off in the northern hemisphere, a negative correlation between latitude and max temperature is very apparent. Therefor we can assume that the lower the latitude the higher the max temperature will generally be. In the southern hemisphere, a positive correlation exists between latitude and temperature, so similarly we can conclude that a strong positive relationship exists between latitude and temperature. 

In the southern hemispher, a very small positive correlation exists between both cloudiness and latitude and humidity and latitude, so we may be able to assume that a city's typical wind speed or humidity is slightly affected by it's latitude. Overall, the biggest trend we can take away from this activity is the correlation between latitude and temperature in both hemispheres.
