# Python-API-Challenge
Python API WeatherPy and VacationPy challenges for UC Davis Data Analytics Bootcamp - Spring 2021

**Part I: Analysis**
From the WeatherPy analysis we can come to a few different general conclusions about weather trends across the globe. 

First off in the northern hemisphere, a negative correlation between latitude and max temperature is very apparent. Therefor we can assume that the lower the latitude the higher the max temperature. In the southern hemisphere, a positive correlation exists between latitude and temperature. Therefor we can say that the higher the latitude the the higher the temperature. 

In the southern hemispher, a very small positive correlation exists between both cloudiness and latitude and humidity and latitude, so we may be able to assume that a city's typical wind speed or humidity is slightly affected by it's latitude. 

Overall, the biggest trend we can take away from this activity is the correlation between latitude and temperature in both hemispheres.
